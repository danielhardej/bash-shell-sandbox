# Translating Linux `bash` commands to Mac commands

While Linux and Mac OS X are both Unix-based, there are some differences between the commands used in the terminal. Here are some common Linux commands and their Mac equivalents.

The simple ones are more or less the same.

| Linux Command | Mac Command | What it does |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| `ls`          | `ls`        | Lists files and directories in the current directory |
| `pwd`         | `pwd`       | Prints the current working directory |
| `cd`          | `cd`        | Changes the current directory |
| `mkdir`       | `mkdir`     | Creates a new directory |
| `rm`          | `rm`        | Removes a file or directory |
| `rmdir`       | `rmdir`     | Removes a directory |
| `cat`          | `cat`         | Concatenates and displays files |
| `cat /etc/passwd` | `dscl . list /Users` | Lists all users on the system |
| `echo`        | `echo`      | Prints text to the terminal |
